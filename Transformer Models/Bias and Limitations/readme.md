<h1>Bias and Limitations</h1>
When using pretrained language models like those based on the Transformer architecture, it's crucial to be aware of inherent biases and limitations. These models are trained on diverse internet content, encompassing both high-quality and problematic material. For instance, using a fill-mask pipeline with BERT may reveal gender biases in predictions, even with apparently neutral training data.

Fine-tuning these models on specific tasks won't eliminate intrinsic biases; it may even amplify or modify them based on the fine-tuning dataset. Users should be cautious about potential biases, including sexism, racism, or homophobia, and must consider the ethical implications of model outputs.

Vigilance, ongoing monitoring, and ethical considerations are essential when deploying pretrained models in real-world applications. Efforts to address and mitigate biases in these models are ongoing in the research community, emphasizing the need for responsible use.
