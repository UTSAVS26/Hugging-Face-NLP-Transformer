<h1>Decoder</h1>

Decoder models, another subset of Transformer models, exclusively utilize the decoder component of the Transformer architecture. These models are characterized by "auto-regressive" attention, allowing attention layers to access only the words positioned before the current word in the sentence at each stage. This restriction makes them particularly suitable for generating sequences of text in an auto-regressive manner.

In the pretraining phase, decoder models typically focus on predicting the next word in a given sentence. This self-supervised learning task enables the model to learn the sequential dependencies and relationships between words, making it well-equipped for text generation.

Decoder models are particularly effective for tasks that involve generating coherent and contextually relevant text. Some common applications include:

1. **Text Generation:** Creating new text passages based on a given prompt or context.

Representative decoder models in this family include:

1. **CTRL:** A model designed for generating diverse and controlled text outputs.

2. **GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer):** One of the pioneering models in this category, known for its ability to generate high-quality and contextually relevant text.

3. **GPT-2:** An enhanced and larger version of GPT, capable of generating even more complex and diverse text.

4. **Transformer XL:** A model that extends the Transformer architecture for longer-term dependencies in sequences, enhancing the capabilities of auto-regressive text generation.

These decoder models excel at tasks where the goal is to generate natural and coherent language based on a given context. Their ability to capture sequential relationships makes them valuable for various applications, such as creative text generation, dialogue systems, and story generation.
