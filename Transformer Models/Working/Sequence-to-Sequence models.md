<h1>Sequence-to-Sequence Model</h1>

Encoder-decoder models, also known as sequence-to-sequence models, leverage both the encoder and decoder components of the Transformer architecture. These models employ a combination of bi-directional attention from the encoder and auto-regressive attention from the decoder. At each stage, the attention layers of the encoder can access all words in the initial sentence, while the attention layers of the decoder can only access words positioned before the current word in the input sequence.

The pretraining objectives for sequence-to-sequence models can be diverse, incorporating elements from both encoder and decoder models. For instance, models like T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) are pretrained by replacing random spans of text with a single mask special word, and the objective is to predict the original text that the mask word replaces.

Sequence-to-sequence models are well-suited for tasks that involve generating new sentences based on a given input. Some common applications include:

1. **Summarization:** Condensing lengthy text passages into concise summaries.
  
2. **Translation:** Translating text from one language to another.
  
3. **Generative Question Answering:** Generating contextually relevant answers to questions.

Representative sequence-to-sequence models in this family include:

1. **BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers):** A model designed for both bidirectional and auto-regressive tasks, excelling in tasks like summarization and text generation.

2. **mBART (Multilingual BART):** An extension of BART with a focus on multilingual applications, capable of handling various languages.

3. **Marian:** A sequence-to-sequence model designed for neural machine translation tasks, particularly known for its efficiency.

4. **T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer):** A versatile model pretrained on a text-to-text framework, making it adaptable to various NLP tasks.

These models are powerful tools for tasks that require generating coherent and contextually relevant text outputs based on a given input. Their flexibility and effectiveness make them valuable for applications ranging from language translation to content summarization and beyond.
