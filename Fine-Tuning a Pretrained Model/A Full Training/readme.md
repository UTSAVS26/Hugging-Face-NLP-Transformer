<h1>Full Training Without Trainer</h1>

<p>In this section, we'll explore how to perform a full training without using the Trainer class. Assuming you have completed the data processing in section 2, here's a summary of the process:</p>

<h2>1. Prepare for Training</h2>

<p>Load and preprocess the dataset, create a tokenizer, and define a data collator for padding.</p>

<h2>2. Define Data Loaders</h2>

<p>Remove unnecessary columns, rename labels, and set the dataset format to return PyTorch tensors. Create train and eval data loaders.</p>

<h2>3. Model Instantiation</h2>

<p>Instantiate an AutoModelForSequenceClassification with the desired number of labels.</p>

<h2>4. Optimizer and Scheduler</h2>

<p>Define an optimizer (AdamW) and a linear learning rate scheduler.</p>

<h2>5. Training Loop</h2>

<p>Use a training loop to iterate over epochs and batches. Utilize tqdm for progress tracking and send batches to the GPU if available.</p>

<h2>6. Evaluation Loop</h2>

<p>Implement an evaluation loop using a metric from the ðŸ¤— Evaluate library. Accumulate batches and compute the final metrics.</p>

<h2>7. Supercharge with ðŸ¤— Accelerate</h2>

<p>Enhance the training loop with distributed training support using ðŸ¤— Accelerate. Adjustments include importing Accelerator, preparing data loaders, and utilizing the accelerator.backward() method.</p>

<h3>Example:</h3>

<p>To fine-tune a model on the SST-2 dataset, modify the training loop accordingly.</p>
