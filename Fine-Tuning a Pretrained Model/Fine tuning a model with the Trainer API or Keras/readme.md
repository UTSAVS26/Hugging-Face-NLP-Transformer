<h1>Fine-tuning a Model with Trainer API</h1>

<p>The Trainer API in ðŸ¤— Transformers simplifies the process of fine-tuning a pre-trained model on a custom dataset. Here's a concise guide on how to use it:</p>

<h2>1. Data Preprocessing</h2>

<p>Load and preprocess the dataset using the ðŸ¤— Datasets library and a BERT-based tokenizer.</p>

<h2>2. Define Training Arguments</h2>

<p>Create a TrainingArguments object specifying the directory to save the trained model.</p>

<h2>3. Model Definition</h2>

<p>Instantiate an AutoModelForSequenceClassification with the desired number of labels.</p>

<h2>4. Create Trainer</h2>

<p>Initialize a Trainer by providing the model, training arguments, datasets, data collator, and tokenizer.</p>

<h2>5. Fine-tune the Model</h2>

<p>Call the train() method on the Trainer to start the fine-tuning process.</p>

<h2>6. Evaluate the Model</h2>

<p>Optionally, define a compute_metrics() function to evaluate the model's performance and use it during training.</p>

<p>These steps allow you to efficiently fine-tune a model on your custom dataset. The Trainer API handles various aspects, including multi-GPU support and mixed-precision training.</p>

<h3>Example:</h3>

<p>To fine-tune a model on the GLUE SST-2 dataset, follow the same procedure with the appropriate data processing.</p>
