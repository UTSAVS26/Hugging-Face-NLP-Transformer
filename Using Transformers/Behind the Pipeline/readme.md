<h1>NLP Pipeline Unveiled: Behind the Scenes ðŸš€</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Embark on a journey through the inner workings of an NLP pipeline, focusing on sentiment analysis using Hugging Face's Transformers library. This exploration reveals the intricacies of three pivotal steps: preprocessing, model inference, and postprocessing.</p>

<h2>Unveiling the Three Steps</h2>

<h3>1. Tokenization and Preprocessing ðŸ§ </h3>
<p>At the beginning, raw text transforms to become model-ready. Tokenization, led by a specialized tokenizer, breaks down the text into tokens, maps them to integers, and introduces relevant inputs. This crucial preprocessing step ensures seamless interaction with the model.</p>

<h3>2. Model Inference ðŸ¤–</h3>
<p>Once preprocessed, the inputs travel through the model. Acquired via AutoModel, the model produces high-dimensional vectors (hidden states). These vectors, representing the contextual understanding of the input, undergo processing by the model's dedicated head, designed for tasks like sequence classification.</p>

<h3>3. Postprocessing and Interpretation ðŸ“Š</h3>
<p>Raw outputs, in the form of logits, undergo postprocessing to yield meaningful probabilities. Applying softmax to logits transforms them into interpretable probability scores. The model's configuration provides a key mapping of indices to labels, facilitating the interpretation of results.</p>

<h2>Setting the Stage for Exploration</h2>
<p>Understanding the interplay of tokenization, model inference, and postprocessing lays the foundation for a deeper exploration. Interpretation of the model's predictions and exploration of advanced techniques can further enrich the understanding of NLP pipelines. This knowledge is essential for users aiming to tailor and optimize their applications.</p>
